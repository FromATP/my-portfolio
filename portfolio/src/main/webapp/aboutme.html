            <img src="image/FPGA.jpg" width="400"/>
            <p>Above shows one of my assignments</p> 
            <p>I use Verilog to complete a single RISCV processor</p>
            <p>then write the assembly code that can do mathmatical operations such as +,-,*</p>
            <p>and finally write them to a FPGA board.</p>

            <p>That was my first time to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seam_carving">Seam Carving</a>...</p>
            <p>On the left is the original picture, and right is the result.</p>
            <p>When my friends and I saw the picture, we laughed for all evening(:P)</p>
            <p>Curious about how I did it ???</p>
            <p>U just need to change a "<" into ">", make your program delete the most important lines in the picture....</p>
        <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>If I were free, I would rather stay at home by myself than go out to take part in social activities.</p>
            <p>So what I am interested in are those can kill my time alone.</p>
            <p>Handicrafts such as painting, carving, origami are my favorites</p>
            <p>Also, I'm addicted in indie games such as Hollow Knight, Cuphead, The Witcher, etc.</p>
